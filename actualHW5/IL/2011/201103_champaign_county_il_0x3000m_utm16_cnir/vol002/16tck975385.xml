        Radiometry is verified by visual inspection of the digital orthophoto.  Slight systematic radiometric differences may exist between adjacent orthoimage files; these are due primarily to differences in source image capture dates and sun angles along flight lines. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent orthoimage file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during the mosaicking process which may serve to lighten or darken adjacent images for better color tone matching.

            The horizontal accuracy of the orthorectified images is mainly determined by the quality of the DEM. The elevation data consisted of auto-correlated and edited data produced by AeroMetric. All photo identifiable checkpoints were measured in the final orthos and compared to the surveyed checkpoints to determine the RMSE. All rectified chip overlap was checked for greater than 3 pixel mismatches. All final tiles were checked visually for edge matching.

          The DMC images were aerotriangulated to support digital ortho image production for the Illinois statewide project area.  Airborne GPS/IMU was processed and ground check point data was provided by AeroMetric, Inc.  The project was referenced to the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83), UTM Zone 16 horizontally and to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) vertically.  Units were in meters.


The DMC images, ABGPS/IMU data, and ground check point data were used as inputs to the ICAROS Automatic Triangulation softcopy program.  ICAROS correlated image points for the block of images and created a solution resulting in exposure station exterior orientations.  All ground points were manually measured on the imagery.  These points were included in the aerotriangulation adjustments for absolute ground location verification.

 

The scale of the aerial photos was 1:12,696.  The photography was exposed between 3/16/11 and 5/30/11.

DEM data was auto-correlated using Match-T and edited via DTMaster in stereo.

Rectification was done using the aerotriangulation data, raw DMC images, and DEM data.  These rectified images were used to generate auto-seamlines which were then reviewed and edited manually.  The images were then adjusted and used with the seams to mosaic, balance, and cut out large tiles which were reviewed and blunders were corrected as well as other edits performed. The final 1500m tiles were then cut from the big tiles and formatted for delivery.

        Four band orthoimagery is organized in four color bands or channels which represent the red, green, blue, and near-infrared portions of the spectrum.  Each image pixel is assigned a quadruple numeric value, one for each color band.  Numeric values range from 0 to 255. Areas where data is incomplete due to lack of full image coverage are represented with the numeric value of 0.
