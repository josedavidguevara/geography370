    <h1> Homework 3: In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>I started by downloading the shapefile of the globe's country, and used the indicatrix plug in to 
        see the distortions the default projection had (4326). Then, using the feature on the bottom right, I changed the project CRS
        to different projections, which is known as reprojecting on the fly. The indicatrix allowed me to 
        observe the different ways different projections distort the map
    </p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The shape and size of countries seem to be
        pretty well preserved, especially towards the center.
    </h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection looks more like an oval, and it seems less
        two-dimensional that the previous one. The lines are curved on this one.
    </h3>

    </a>
    <h2>Pseudo Mercator</h2>
    <h3>This is the projection I am most familiar with. However, I can now tell
        how dramatic the size distortion is when it comes to countries
        like greenland.
    </h3>

    </a>
    <h2>Winkel I</h2>
    <h3>This projection also has a globe-ish
        shape, like the Aitoff, but this one is more elongated and the indicator
        dots are on straighter lines
    </h3>

    <h2>Equal Area Cylindrical</h2>
    <h3>This projection distorts shape, especially at the poles,
        but it preserves area. This might be useful when you need to know
        the size of countries.
    </h3>

    <h2>Equidistant Conic</h2>
    <h3>This projection preserves distances along the meridian but distorts shape and size</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/54027.png">
    <img src=".//maps/54027.png" alt="Equidistan Conic" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <h2> Azimuthal Equidistant</h2>
    <h3>This projection looks like the UN logo. It is centered
        around the north pole, and preserves distance and direction from the center"
    </h3>

    <h2>Natural Earth II</h2>
    <h3>This map compromises all aspects in order to reduce overall distortion.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2>Orthographic (View from Space)</h2>
    <h3>This projection looks most like a globe, while
        you can't see the entire world (it gets distorted in the ends) it
        is a good representation of one side of the planet.
    </h3>

    <!--<h2 style="color:red">Now, you should <u>add the following projections on your own:</u></h2>
    <h3>EPSG: 54034, 54027, 102016, and two additional projections that you choose.</h3> -->
